# Domain docs

How domain-modeling-aware skills (`grill-with-docs`, `domain-modeling`,
`to-spec`, `to-tickets`, `improve-codebase-architecture`) should consume this
repo's domain documentation, and how it relates to any existing `docs/` tree.

## Two different kinds of ground

An existing `docs/` tree (if this repo has one) is **published** ground:
finished reference material, written and maintained by hand. Don't restructure
it or fold `GLOSSARY.md` into it.

`GLOSSARY.md` and `docs/adr/` are the **live** ground that `domain-modeling`
maintains as `emet` runs features through this repo: its ubiquitous language
and the architectural decisions made along the way. Both exist
already and change only when a term or a decision actually crystallizes during
a `grill-with-docs` session, never speculatively.

## Before exploring, read these

- **[`GLOSSARY.md`](../../GLOSSARY.md)** at the repo root.
- **[`docs/adr/`](../adr/README.md)**: read the ADRs that touch the area you're
  about to work in.

## File structure

aokit is a Bun workspace with two packages (`packages/aokit`, `packages/module`); the glossary and the ADRs are shared by the whole repository, so there is one context.

```
/
├── GLOSSARY.md
└── docs/adr/
    ├── README.md
    └── NNNN-kebab-title.md
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (an issue title, a ticket, a test
name), use the term as defined in `GLOSSARY.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the
glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal: either
you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider), or there's a
real gap worth noting for `domain-modeling` to close.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than
silently overriding it — e.g. "Contradicts ADR-0003 (X), but worth reopening
because Y."
